# Raspberry Pi WPA2 Enterprise
Guide on how to connect your Raspberry Pi to a WPA2-Enterprise Network

# Introduction
The Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a low-cost Single Board Computer. Since it’s original release in 2012, a total of over 36 million devices have been sold so far, making it one of the best selling computers of all time. Despite the original objective to provide a low-cost computing platform enabling people to explore computing and learn to write code, the RPi owes its popularity to its low price, connectivity and versatility. This has allowed both professionals and hobbyist to make use of the RPi in various applications ranging from simple projects to full commercial products. 

In healthcare, recent advancements of sensor technology and the application of “internet of things” (IoT) devices hold a potential to transform healthcare. The use of these devices allows for improved insight of disease by gathering and exchanging data with other systems over the Internet without any human intervention. A good example is remote patient monitoring, which has seen a substantial uprise fueled by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The application of IoT devices may have a substantial impact on reducing healthcare costs and improving treatment outcomes. However, prototyping these kind of solutions do demand all sorts of different sensors with different types of interfaces. The RPi may offer a low-cost and scalable platform to develop IoT solutions due to its abundant connectivity options (USB, GPIO, etc )and open source software which allows for easy integration of different protocols.  

Despite this, using a RPi in a hospital environment is not always easy. Especially when it comes to WiFi connectivity without a dedicated IoT-network. The RPi is shipped without an operating system (OS), allowing the end-user to choose their OS to suit their needs. Raspberry Pi OS is a linux-based operating system optimized for the RPi and provides an adequate choice OS for the RPi. There a multiple variations of the OS including 64- and 32-bit versions and versions with and without a graphic user interface (GUI). Raspberry Pi OS by default does not support enterprise WiFi security (WPA2-Enterpise and 802.1X), a common standard in hospital wireless networks.

As Raspberry Pi OS is based on Linux, it can be configured to allow connectivity to WPA2-Enterprise network using the terminal and tweaking the network interface file, DHCP and WiFi config files.  Therefore, I put together this guide on how to modify these files allowing you to connect your RPi to a WPA2-Enterprise network
